<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Team Techquilla has come up with a one-stop platform for parents who can enrol with us for their child‚Äôs school admission. They are required to fill just one single common application form to apply to all schools in their city. The platform provides the following information from the comfort of their houses:
* No. of vacancies in each school
* Notification of opening of admissions in every school they put in their wishlist
* Profile page for every school with photos and videos, apart from extra information the school wishes to put out.
Apart from admission application feasibility, the platform offers the following features:
* Video interviewing facility for the admission process
* One single payment portal to pay for all school application fee


### Built With

We build our backend using the following technologies:
* Database- Cloud Firestore
* Authentication- Firebase Authentication
* Storage - Firebase Storage
* Cloud messaging- Firebase Messaging
For the frontend, we used:
* UI/UX- Flutter
* Video calling- Agora API
* Payments- Stripe API
